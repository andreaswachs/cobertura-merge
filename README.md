# THIS IS A FORK

The original work has been done by [Borre Mosch](https://github.com/borremosch/cobertura-merge).

I have desperately needed to have the possiblity to use a file glob pattern to find coverage files strewn throughout nested directories, and have taken the quick route to publish this package while the official PR is under review.

Use this package at your own will.
